## About Me
Hoi! My name is Alex Jeon. I'm currently attending UBC as a first year science student who is hoping to purse a major in Mathematics and Computer Science!

## My *Biased* Takes on Courses if you happen to care 
### CPSC 110: Computation, Programs, and Programming

### CPSC 121: Models of Computation

### MATH 221: Matrix Algebra

### ENGL 110: Approaches to Literature and Culture

### PHYS 100: Introductory Physics

### CPSC 210: Software Constructionw

### MATH 200: Calculus III
There isn't much to say about MATH 200. I took a virtual lecture section so the lectures were recorded on zoom. The midterm and finals were reasonable covering much of the topics we learned. A good way to study for them is to go hit the textbook questions. One comment I have to make is I wish that past midterms were given unlike the past final exams (which can be found [here](https://secure.math.ubc.ca/Ugrad/pastExams/)).

### WRDS 150B 941: Writing and Research in the Disciplines - RSRCH&WRIT HUMAN
I took WRDS 150B with Dr Gagnon. Her course was focused on video games and its culture. Dr Gagnon was an awesome and attentive professor who really cares about the material she is teaching. The course format was through Zoom. We had asynchronous lectures and synchronous discussions. For the asynch lectures, we had to watch a pre-recorded lecture video. For the synch lectures, we would cover the materials from thet asynch lecture and discuss through chat or raising our hands on zoom. The course begins by introducing how to read, evaulate, cite scholarly journals and naturally progresses to writing a literature review covering some of the readings we have done throughout the course and a presentation showing your work. I'm really glad tohave taken this course as I think it will be helpful in the future for writing academic research papers.

### PHYS 131: Energy and Waves
I took PHYS 131 to fulfill my science breadth requirement. I thought the course was a natural progression of PHYS 100. We covered topics such as fluids, SHM, travelling & standing & sounds waves, sound & Light interference, diffraction. 
There were pre-readings to do before lecture and homework/lecture questions due at the end of the week. The lectures are recorded, but be mindful iClicker is used to mark for participation. There are tutorials, which started out as just doing some questions and progressed to a mandatory attendance tutorial where you have to go for attendance and finish the questions. I thought the tutorial questions were helpful as they were from past exams, but I'm not sure if the tutorials themselves were very helpful. The only merit I could think of is that the TA is right there if you want to ask a question and if you are an individual who prefers collaborative environments this is certainly for you.
There was one midterm and three quizzes as far as tests go. One issue with these was that they were on canvas and is marked based on whether you have an answer within the error margin, but it doesn't give you any partial marks for any work that you may have done. Past that, they weren't too bad and I liked that we were allowed to do it where we wanted to take it (ie. my dorm).

### EOSC 111: Laboratory Exploration of Planet Earth 
I took EOSC 111 as a means to fulfill my laboratory requirements for my degree (as did many others). There were in total 10 collaborative labs that covers a broad spectrum of EOSC ranging from dinosaurs to sedimentary rocks to waves. There was a little individual and group quiz at the start of class that tests your retention of your pre-readings. Once you know what the quizzes test you on, it's pretty easy to filter out what you need to focus on in the pre-readings. Overall, I thought this was a fun and chill lab course if you happen to be looking for a way to fulfill the labortory requirements or are looking for away to complement any other EOSC course.

There are no finals or midterms. The course ends a few weeks before finals week.
