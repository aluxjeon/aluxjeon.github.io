## About Me
Hoi! My name is Alex Jeon. I'm currently attending UBC as a first year science student who is hoping to purse a major in Mathematics and Computer Science!

## My *Biased* Takes on Courses if you happen to care 
### CPSC 110: Computation, Programs, and Programming

### CPSC 121: Models of Computation

### MATH 221: Matrix Algebra

### ENGL 110: Approaches to Literature and Culture

### PHYS 100: Introductory Physics

### CPSC 210: Software Construction

### MATH 200: Calculus III

### WRDS 150B 941: Writing and Research in the Disciplines - RSRCH&WRIT HUMAN

### PHYS 131: Energy and Waves
I took PHYS 131 to fulfill my science breadth requirement. I thought the course was a natural progression of PHYS 100. We covered topics such as fluids, SHM, travelling & standing & sounds waves, sound & Light interference, diffraction. 
There were pre-readings to do before lecture and homework/lecture questions due at the end of the week. The lectures are recorded, but be mindful iClicker is used to mark for participation. There are tutorials, which started out as just doing some questions and progressed to a mandatory attendance tutorial where you have to go for attendance and finish the questions. I thought the tutorial questions were helpful as they were from past exams, but I'm not sure if the tutorials themselves were very helpful. The only merit I could think of is that the TA is right there if you want to ask a question and if you are an individual who prefers collaborative environments this is certainly for you.

### EOSC 111: Laboratory Exploration of Planet Earth 
I took EOSC 111 as a means to fulfill my laboratory requirements for my degree (as did many others). There were in total 10 collaborative labs that covers a broad spectrum of EOSC ranging from dinosaurs to sedimentary rocks to waves. There was a little individual and group quiz at the start of class that tests your retention of your pre-readings. Once you know what the quizzes test you on, it's pretty easy to filter out what you need to focus on in the pre-readings. Overall, I thought this was a fun and chill lab course if you happen to be looking for a way to fulfill the labortory requirements or are looking for away to complement any other EOSC course.
